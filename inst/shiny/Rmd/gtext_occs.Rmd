### **Component: Obtain Occurrence Records**

**ORIENTATION**

Niche/distributional modeling analyses require georeferenced occurrence records for the species (e.g., with latitude/longitude). At present, Component **Obtain Occurrence Records** focuses on data documenting the *presence* of the species (i.e., not any information on its absence or non-detection; Franklin 2010 chap. 4; Peterson et al. 2011 chapter 5; Anderson 2012). *Wallace* currently allows users either to: 1) obtain occurrence records from selected online biodiversity databases and download the results (Module ***Query Database***); or 2) upload their own dataset (Module ***User-specified Occurrences***).
