### **Component: Visualize Model Results**

**ORIENTATION**

Niche/distributional models can be used to make predictions across geographic space, and the modeled response can be examined in environmental space as well (Elith and Graham 2009; Guisan and Zimmermann 2000). Component **Visualize Model Results** gives the user options for visualizations from both perspectives. *Wallace* provides 1) bivariate environmental envelope plots for BIOCLIM models (Module ***BIOCLIM Envelope Plots***), 2) plots showing evaluation results over the range of Maxent models explored (Module ***Maxent Evaluation Plots***), 3) response curves that depict how model response relates to changes in the environmental predictor variables (Module ***Plot Response Curves***), and 4) maps of model predictions in the study region (Module ***Map Prediction***. All plots are displayed in the "Results" tab.
