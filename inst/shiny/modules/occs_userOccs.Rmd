```{asis, echo = {{occs_userOccs_knit}}, eval = {{occs_userOccs_knit}}, include = {{occs_userOccs_knit}}}
User CSV path with occurrence data. If the CSV file is not in the current workspace, change to the correct file path (e.g. "/Users/darwin/Documents/occs.user").
```

```{r, echo = {{occs_userOccs_knit}}}
# # NOTE: provide the path to the .csv file
# occs.path <- ""
# # get a list of species occurrence data
# occs.user <- occs_userOccs(csvPath = occs.path, csvName = "{{userOccsCsvName}}")
# occs.{{sp}} <- occs.user[["{{spName}}"]]$cleaned
```
