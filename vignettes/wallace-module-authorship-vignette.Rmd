## *Wallace* modules (v.1.9.0)

*Wallace* is an `R`-based, interactive application for reproducible ecological modeling. The application is also expandible via the addition of new modules, which in *Wallace* are discrete parts of the modeling analysis. This vignette steps through the module authorship process, focusing on the steps involved in adding a module, and also on best practices and some troubleshooting. This vignette was tailored for researchers who would like to author their own *Wallace* module based on some technique they'd like to disseminate to the community or use themselves within the *Wallace* workflow. Thus to follow along, it will help to have at least an intermediate understanding of `R` programming. Also, please see our <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12945" target="_blank">publication</a> in *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* to read in detail about our philosophy for *Wallace*, the modularity of the application, and our vision for module authorship.

*Wallace* is built using an R package for developing graphic user interface applications called `shiny`, and the modules in *Wallace* are structured as `shiny` modules. Before proceeding, it is advisable to read through the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> on `shiny` to give you a firm foundation of the basics. Also very helpful is this <a=href "https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html" target="_blank">instructional page</a>
<!-- CM: link not working -->
on `shiny` modules. For further reading, there are many more `shiny` informational resources <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/" target="_blank">here</a> as well.

First, a brief outline of the file structure of the `wallace` package. The starred directories/files are the ones we'll be concentrating in this vignette. Particular focus will be on the two main scripts `ui.R` and `server.R`, which dictate the main functionality of the application. Also of note is the script that includes helper functions, and the directories for modules (`/inst/shiny/modules`), module functions (`/R`) guidance text (`/inst/shiny/Rmd`).

## Module structure overview

There are 5 necessary steps to adding a functional module: 1) write an R function, 2) write a `shiny` module that calls this R function, 3) modify `ui.R` to display your module's controls, 4) modify `server.R` to implement your module's functionality when these controls are used, and finally 5) write an R Markdown file that includes the guidance text for your module. The example we will go over is for a module that implements a generalized additive model (GAM). As *Wallace* currently focuses on models of species niches and distributions that lack absence data, this GAM will be binomial (predicting the probability of a binary outcome) and tailored to presence-only occurrence data, which means that instead of real absence data we'll use background values instead (sometimes referred to as "pseudo-absences").

## Step 1: Write a function

Let's first write a function that carries out the module's analysis. This function takes the following inputs: environmental predictor values at 1) occurrence points, 2) background points, 3) degrees of freedom for the spline smoothing terms in the GAM, 4) the species name, and 5) shinyLogs. The last one, shinyLogs, is a "reactive" object (in particular for this case, `shiny::reactiveVal()`) that holds all the text and HTML formatting for the log window. Reactive objects are dynamic entities that update whenever the user makes a change using the shiny interface (i.e., pushes a button, selects a value), and are necessary for shiny to be functional. However, they will not work for regular R functions. Thus, when the function is run inside *Wallace*, the parameter "shinyLogs" should be set to the reactive object with the same name. When this is done, messages entered with `writeLog()` will be sent to the *Wallace* log window, and `smartProgress()` will generate a shiny progress bar in the lower-right corner of the interface. When the function is run outside *Wallace*, just leave shinyLogs at its default NULL, which will make `writeLog()` and `smartProgress()` print messages and progress bars to the R console, respectively.

Let's now write a function that fits a GAM and outputs the model object. Save the code below as a script to: `wallace/R/runGAM.R`.

```{r}
runGAM <- function(occs.vals, bg.vals, degFr, spN, shinyLogs=NULL) {
  if(!require(gam)) {
    shinyLogs %>% writeLog("Please install the gam package before running.")
    return()
  }
  # make vector of each variable wrapped in the spline function s() with
  # the assigned degrees of freedom
  degFrs <- paste0("s(", names(occs.vals), ", ", degFr, ")")
  # bind all environmental values together
  vals <- rbind(occs.vals, bg.vals)
  # make vector of 1's and 0's for identifying occurrence from background
  bin <- c(rep(1, nrow(occs.vals)), rep(0, nrow(bg.vals)))
  # put everything together in a table for modeling
  d <- data.frame(pa = bin, vals)
  # make formula
  f <- as.formula(paste("pa", paste(degFrs, collapse = " + "), sep = " ~ "))
  # run the GAM
  smartProgress(shinyLogs, message = paste("Running GAM for", spName), {
    mod <- gam(f, family = "binomial", data = d)
  })
  # write log message
  shinyLogs %>% writeLog("GAM ran successfully for ", em(spName(spN)), ".")
  # output model object
  return(mod)
}
```

## Step 2: Write a `shiny` module that calls your function

Before moving forward, we should go over some important points about the structure of the data that *Wallace* stores on species. All data specific to a species is recorded in a reactiveValues list, the reactive version of a regular list, called `spp`. To access the data on the species currently selected, we index `spp` with a reactive function that returns the selected species' name, called `curSp()` in this way: `spp[[curSp()]]`. This gives us a list of data objects for the selected species. It is necessary to use a reactive function to retrieve the species name because this name is dependent on which species is currently selected by the user.
<!-- CM: show an example of this spp -->

Please find below the complete list of reactive functions used internally in *Wallace* as shortcuts that return characters (i.e. text) based on user selections.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis", eval=TRUE} 
df1 <- data.frame("shortcut"=c("curSp()","curMsp()", "allSp()","spIn()","curEnv()","curModel()","component()","module()"),
                  "output"=c("selected species name",'selected species names separated by "|"',"vector of all species names","if batch on, all species names, if batch off, selected species name", "selected environmental variable","selected model","selected component","selected module"))
knitr::kable(df1)
```

In addition, some data objects that are used often in the analysis are stored as top entities, such as the occurrence data table (`spp[[curSp()]]$occs`), the environmental variable RasterStack (`spp[[curSp()]]$envs`), etc. These objects have reactive functions associated with them as shortcuts. For example, `spp[[curSp()]]$occs` can be accessed with `occs()`, and `spp[[curSp()]]$envs` with `envs()`. **NOTE**: These functions cannot be used to overwrite entities in the list---in this case, you must use the long form. 

For example:

```{r}
# this will not work
occs() <- newDF
# this will work
spp[[curSp()]]$occs <- newDF
```

Please find below the complete list of reactive functions used internally in *Wallace* as shortcuts that return data objects based on user selections.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis", eval=TRUE} 
df2 <- data.frame("description" = c("occurrence locality coordinates", "environmental raster(s)", 
                                    "background locality coordinates", "background extent polygon",
                                    "environmental raster(s) masked to background extent", 
                                    "ENMeval results table", "model prediction raster", 
                                    "model projection raster", "metadata"),
                  "shortcut"=c("occs()","envs()","bg()","bgExt()","bgMask()","evalOut()","mapPred()","mapProj()","rmm()"),
                  "long_form"=c("spp[[curSp()]]$occs",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]$envs",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]$bg",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]\\$procEnvs\\$bgExt",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]\\$procEnvs\\$bgMask",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]$results",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]\\$visualization\\$mapPred",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]\\$project\\$mapProj",
                                "spp[[curSp()]]$rmm"),
                  "class"=c("data frame","Raster*","matrix","SpatialPolygons","Raster*",
                            "data frame","Raster*","Raster*","rangeModelMetadata"))
knitr::kable(df2)
#"character", "character vector", 
```

In the module script, we define two main functions, `runGAM_UI()` and `runGAM_MOD()`, which specify the logic for `ui.R` and `server.R`, respectively. 

The function `runGAM_UI()` details the user interface (UI) controls, including hover text if needed, etc. The parameter "id" is the only one necessary for the module UI function, and should be the ID name you assign to this module when you initialize these functions in `ui.R` and `server.R` (you'll see this later). Shiny modules operate in their own unique namespaces, and so use of the `NS()` function is necessary to ensure the module's UI controls can talk to `ui.R`. The variable `ns` (for namespace), returned from `NS(id)`, is used to wrap around the ID names of shiny UI objects, as in `numericInput(ns("degFr"), ...)`, to enable this connection to `ui.R`. 

This function `runGAM_MOD()` is a wrapper for a shiny reactive expression. Inside, there is a template for the essential parts needed in a *Wallace* module. The first, "ERRORS", catches any possible errors before the module's core functionality is run. If there is an error, it writes a log message and then returns to `server.R`. The user will need to define these errors in order to catch them. Next, we call the function from `/wallace/R` and make sure it returned what we expect. Next, we load the model object into `spp`. Finally, we fill in the right metadata fields for the rangeModelMetadata object in `spp`. As shiny modules are in their own namespaces, if we want to refer to any of the results from the module in `server.R`, we need to put them into the `spp` reactiveValues list. Please note this below in the `runGAM_MOD()` function. 

There are two other functions below this. The first is `runGAM_INFO()`, which includes information on the packages used in the module for the UI around the controls. It is called in `ui.R`. The second is `runGAM_TBL()`, which defines a custom UI with `shiny::renderUI()` that shows the model `summary()` output from the console, and assigns it to `output$evalTbls`, which is a built-in UI for model result displays. It is called in `server.R`. Other modules that plot onto the leaflet map have a "MAP" function as well (see queryDB.R for an example).

Save the code below as a script to: `wallace/inst/shiny/modules/mod_runGAM.R`.

```{r}
# filename: mod_runGAM.R

# this function details the graphic user interface (UI) logic
runGAM_UI <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  tagList(
    tags$div(title="These degrees of freedom represent the smoothing parameter for the splines corresponding to each variable.",
             numericInput(ns("degFr"), "Degrees of Freedom", value = 1))
  )
}

# this function details the server logic (calculations, etc.)
runGAM_MOD <- function(input, output, session) {
  reactive({
    for(sp in spIn()) {
      # ERRORS ####
      # check to make sure partitioning was done in the last component before proceeding
      if(is.null(spp[[sp]]$occs$partition)) {
        shinyLogs %>% writeLog(type = 'error', "Before building a model, please partition 
                               occurrences for cross-validation for", em(spName(curSp())), ".")
        return()
      }
      
      # FUNCTION CALL ####
      # run the module function from /wallace/R
      mod.gam <- runGAM(spp[[sp]]$occs[,names(envs())], spp[[sp]]$bg[,names(envs())], input$degFr, sp, shinyLogs)
      # ensure the model object was returned before proceeding
      req(mod.gam)
      
      # LOAD INTO SPP ####
      spp[[sp]]$results <- mod.gam
      
      # METADATA ####
      spp[[sp]]$rmm$model$algorithm <- "GAM"
      spp[[sp]]$rmm$model$gam$family <- "binominal"
      f <- as.character(mod.gam$formula)
      spp[[sp]]$rmm$model$gam$formula <- paste(f[2],f[1],f[3])
      spp[[sp]]$rmm$model$gam$notes <- "gam package implementation"
    }
  })
}

# this function specifies the visual output
runGAM_TBL <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$evalTbls <- renderUI({
    output$gamSummary <- renderPrint(summary(spp[[curSp()]]$results))
    verbatimTextOutput("gamSummary")
  })
}

# this function specifies metadata used by ui.R
runGAM_INFO <- infoGenerator(modName = "Generalized Additive Model",
                             modAuts = "Trevor Hastie",
                             pkgName = "gam")
```

## Step 3: Modify `ui.R`

Next, the function for our new module's UI must be referenced into the file `ui.R` in order for *Wallace* to display the controls and package information. 

Open `ui.R` and navigate to the MODEL component. We will be adding some code to the existing code block within `shiny::conditionalPanel()`. This function displays UI only if the logical statement in the first parameter is met, which in this case is the user selection of the "Model" component tab. We'll first add a new radio button for our new GAM module, then create a new `conditionalPanel()` block that specifies all the UI necessary for our module. Most of the UI logic is in `runGAM_UI()`, which we defined in `mod_runGAM.R` above. Note here that we use "runGAM_uiID" as our module ID---we will be referencing the same ID name in `server.R`. We also use the *Wallace* internal functions `uiTop()` (in this block) and `uiBottom()` (below the download button) to display the package information we defined in `runGAM_INFO()`. Lastly, we add the `shiny::actionButton()` below the module UI---when we modify `server.R`, we'll add code that runs the module once the user presses this button. 

Please see the comments noting where we made changes to the original "Model" component UI code in `ui.R`.

```{r}
# MODEL ####
conditionalPanel("input.tabs == 'model'",
                 h4("Build and Evaluate Niche Model"),
                 radioButtons("modelSel", "Modules Available:",
                              #begin change: we added GAM to the list here
                              choices = list("BIOCLIM", "Maxent", "GAM")),
                 #end change
                 HTML('<hr>'),
                 conditionalPanel("input.modelSel == 'Maxent'",
                                  uiTop(runMaxent_INFO),
                                  htmlOutput('maxentJar'), br(),
                                  "(", HTML("<font color='blue'><b>NOTE</b></font>"), 
                                  ": see module guidance for troubleshooting tips 
                                  if you are experiencing problems.)",
                                  HTML('<hr>'),
                                  runMaxent_UI('runMaxent_uiID'),
                                  actionButton('goMaxent', 'Run')),
                 conditionalPanel("input.modelSel == 'BIOCLIM'",
                                  uiTop(runBIOCLIM_INFO),
                                  runBIOCLIM_UI('runBIOCLIM_uiID'),
                                  actionButton('goBIOCLIM', 'Run')),
                 #begin change: we added a conditional panel for our module here
                 conditionalPanel("input.modelSel == 'GAM'",
                                  uiTop(runGAM_INFO),
                                  runGAM_UI('runGAM_uiID'),
                                  actionButton('goGAM', 'Run')),
                 #end change
                 HTML('<hr>'),
                 conditionalPanel("input.modelSel == 'Maxent'", uiBottom(runMaxent_INFO)),
                 conditionalPanel("input.modelSel == 'BIOCLIM'", uiBottom(runBIOCLIM_INFO)),
                 #begin change:
                 conditionalPanel("input.modelSel == 'GAM'", uiBottom(runGAM_INFO))
                 #end change
)
```

## Step 4: Modify `server.R`

Finally, we need to call the module and the other functions from `mod_runGAM.R` in `server.R`. Open `server.R` and navigate to the MODEL component. You should see "module Maxent" and "module BIOCLIM" code blocks, wrapped in `observeEvent()`. This `shiny` function initiates whatever is inside the block when an action is taken by the user, which in this case is a button press. The button we are observing is `input$goGAM`, which we just specified in `ui.R`. The `input$` part is needed to get entities defined in `ui.R` when we are in `server.R`. 

Within this `observeEvent()` block, we will call our module with `shiny::callModule()`. We assign the reactive expression output to a variable, and then initialize it by running the module function on the next line. We do not assign the module initialization itself to a variable because this module has no output---all the data generated is internally added to the reactiveValues list `spp`. We then check to make sure the results were saved by initializing the reactive shortcut function `results()` (see Tbl. 2) and wrapping it in `req()`, which will throw an error if `results()` is empty. Next, we run our specialized table function, which displays the model results in the "Results" tab of the map window. Finally, we make some UI updates (which can only be made in `server.R`) to switch to the "Results" tab automatically to view the table, and to update the module selection in the next component to display only those relevant to GAMs (which for now is just "Map Prediction").

```{r}
# # # # # # # # # # # # 
# module GAM ####
# # # # # # # # # # # # 
observeEvent(input$goGAM, {
  # assign module function to variable
  mod.gam <- callModule(runGAM_MOD, 'runGAM')
  # initialize module
  mod.gam()
  # make sure the results were entered before proceeding
  req(evalOut())
  # initialize GAM results table
  runGAM_TBL(input, output, session)
  # switch to Results tab
  updateTabsetPanel(session, 'main', selected = 'Results')
  # update radio buttons for Visualization component
  updateRadioButtons(session, "visSel", choices = list("Map Prediction" = 'mapPreds'))
})
```

## Step 5: Write `gtext_model_runGAM.Rmd`

The last step, and one which is vital, is writing guidance text for your module. This text is meant for the benefit of other users who would like to read a detailed description of what your module does and where to find more relevant information. 

There are three categories for guidance text. BACKGROUND provides general information about the framing of the module's technique in the grand scheme of things. IMPLEMENTATION describes how the technique is used in this module. Finally, REFERENCES is a bibliography of academic sources that are referenced in the text.

Save the code below as a script to: `wallace/inst/shiny/Rmd/gtext_model_GAM.R`. This filename is a combination of the component shortcut name "model" (from the tabPanel value name in `ui.R`) and the module shortcut name "GAM" (from the radio button ID in `ui.R`). Code in `server.R` automatically references the guidance text if the name matches this syntax and loads it in the "Component Guidance" and "Module Guidance" tabs in the map window.

```{markdown}

```

As we improve *Wallace* and release new versions, we always make a big effort to simplify the module authorship process.
